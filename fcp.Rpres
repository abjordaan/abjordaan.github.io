Prediction
========================================================

Motor Trend Car Road Tests will be used to predict the feul consumption. Tee following attributes are used:

- Weight
- Horsepower
- Cylinders

If the weight, horsepower and number of cylinders are know, we will be able to predict teh milage of the car per galon of fuel. We will apply our algorithm on the mtcars dataset wich is the data extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models). 

MTCARS data set
========================================================

There are 11 variables but the most important ones are: mpg (Miles/(US) gallon), cyl (Number of cylinders) and wt (Weight (1000 lbs).

Basic observation:

```{r}
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)

```

Prediction
========================================================

Prediction algorithm -> standard linear regression (weight, cylinders and horsepower)

model <- lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl + hp, data = mtcars)

Prediction outcome
========================================================

Succesfully predicted fuel consumption!

predict(linear_model,newdata=data.frame(wt=weight,cyl=cylinders,hp=horsepower))

Weight: 3.33, horse power: 123, number of cylinders: 6

Total feaul consumpotion: 20.33738 mpg
